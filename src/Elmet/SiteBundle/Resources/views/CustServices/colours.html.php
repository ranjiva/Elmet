<h1>Colours Displayed on our Web Site</h1>

<p>
    Elmet Curtains takes every care to ensure that the curtain colours displayed on our website match the
    curtain cloth that we have in our factory. However the colour that is displayed on the web page is 
    ultimately dependent on the settings of the screen on which the web page is displayed e.g. colour temperature. 
    As such the colour seen on the screen can differ from the colour of the curtain cloth in our factory. 
    Clearly this is out of our control. Therefore, if getting the exact colour for your curtains is important 
    to you, for example if you wish to ensure that your curtains match your other furnishings, 
    then please order a <a href="/customerservices/samples">sample</a> from us, before ordering your curtains.
